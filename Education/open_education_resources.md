## Tools for self learning and course development
* New graduate students trying to figure out somethign that was always expected but never taught: [CSAILS Missing CS Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

* A list of open-source free online computer science courses is available: [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BD8BJJUNaX63m2QmySWMGDp71nx4W4MyyiIBlfMoN3Q/htmlview).

* If you want to learn python (or any other practical programming concept) use [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/). Python course on Learning Lab [here](https://lab.github.com/everydeveloper/introduction-to-python). Here is a third party more advanced python tutorial ([github](https://github.com/Akuli/python-tutorial)).

* Learning just about anything else techy: [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/).

* [Web design in 4 minutes](https://jgthms.com/web-design-in-4-minutes) (simple but clever).

* [AMSI Maths of Machine / Deep Learning Course](https://deeplearningmath.org/)


## Teaching & collaborating virtually.
* [Explain Everything Digital Whiteboard](explaineverything.com)
* Shared notes are great through Dropbox paper (esp. using scribble on the iPad) 
* Google docs has predictive text and grammar so no one can tell me there's a better option for writing documents (I guess overleaf but anyway).
