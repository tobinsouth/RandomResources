# My Coding Setup

I've used a lot of different setups for data science and it changes all the time. This is just a quick little list in case someone (myself included) needs to look at it.

- Use VSCode to write most major code (including Jupyter Notebooks)
- Attempt to use Git repositories to mainly work versions of projects.
- Use Dropbox to sync everything (including the git clones)
- Dracula colour for everything
